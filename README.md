# 2DVerletIntegrationInUnity
**Project Overview:**
A set of scripts to model a 2D physics system using Verlet Integration as the foundation for the methods. These scripts are specifically designed to be integrated with procedural animation and a game controller. The goal of the physics system is to be efficient enough to handle soft body floors and walls while having a physics based player.


Needed Functionality:
-Points with Verlet Integration
-Circle and line collision constraints
-Static collision constraints
-Distance/Chain Joints
-Angular Joint Constraints
